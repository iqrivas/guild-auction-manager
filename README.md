# Guild Auction Manager

## Introduction

In the game **Elder Scrolls Online** players use **guilds** to join efforts to crowdfund certain in-game benefits, such as hiring a **Guild Trader** every week that will allow them to sell their adventure's loot to other players, but this does not come cheap.

**Auctions** are one way for the Guilds to gather funds from its members by auctioning certain special items that are donated by other guild members.

Guild Auction Events are often held **in-game**, where players use features such as voice-chat and text-chat to interact during the event. This comes with limitations such as maximum players allowed in voice-chat or long standing known issues. Also, not all players may be available at the time of the Auction considering different time zones or having a busy schedule.

## Objectives

-   Provide an alternative auction process where members have a greater range of time to participate in Guild Auction Events

-   Provide a better management and collaboration tool for auction organizers

-   Increase transparency of total amounts collected and member participation

## Challenges faced during the project

- Getting the websockets to work was a bit confusing at first since ActionCable was not working properly until I setup Redis. Once this was running, setting up the channels and messages was not complicated.

-   When transitioning the project from sqlite3 to Postgresql, there were some configuration issues on my machine that took a while to resolve. This was a step required to make a deployment to Heroku since sqlite3 is not supported. Iâ€™ll take some more time to follow-up my learning on other deployment options.
    - TODO: Deploy the application

## Run Locally

The project uses the following:
- Ruby version 3.1.2
- Redis for ActionCable
- Devise for Authentication
- Pundit for Authorization
- main branch uses sqlite3 database

To run the project, consider the following:

    # You must have Ruby installed

    # 1. Install a Ruby version manager

    # Install rbenv from github repo
    # https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
    # Restart console
    eval "$(rbenv init - bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
    # Check your versions
    rbenv -v
    ruby -v
    # Install Ruby version & set global or local version
    rbenv install 3.1.2
    rbenv global 3.1.2

    # Clone the repository, access repository and install dependencies
    https://github.com/iqrivas/guild-auction-manager.git
    cd guild-auction-manager
    bundle install
    rbenv rehash

    # Run migrations
    rails db:migrate
    # Add some sample data
    rails db:seed

    #To be able to use the rails-erd gem, you will need Graphviz
    sudo apt-get install graphviz

You will need some servers to get the app running:

    # If you don't have Redis you can install
    sudo apt install redis
    # Start the Redis Server
    $ redis-server

    # Start a Rails Server
    $ rails server

Open localhost:3000 in your browser
